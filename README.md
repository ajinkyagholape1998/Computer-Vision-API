Recognizing Faces Using Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API

In this repository, I have shown how we can use rest API like Microsoft Azure Computer vision API for processing images and returning information by uploading an image. Microsoft Computer Vision API can analyze visual content and give the response in return in the form of json.

**For Example:**

In this example, Browse an image using Browse Image button, this will request the API to analyze. The responce will be given as JSON.
The button Save Button is given for saving the analyzed image.
